# Making Reading and the Joy of Reading Accessible. 

<b>Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation</b>
<br>Karen Landeros -- DH-110 -- Spring 2021



After the initial wave of lockdowns and closures, many things become more accessible from home, especially reading. Ebooks have been on the rise for years now but even now, the ebook industry experienced a boom during lockdowns. My project will touch on two free websites: Goodreads and Libby. I’ve found myself using both of these applications now more than ever. However, just from my own experiences, I know both can be difficult to use. One site is not mindful of those who need accessibility settings/control on due to their age. While the one focuses completely on the reading experience, neglecting other possible features that may be needed by those who are older (65+). I want to add in my own touches to these sites because if they are accessible to older people, they’ll be accessible to everyone. Accessibility should never be forgotten (I.e different types of users should always be kept in mind). 

And everyone especially describes a chance to share what they love with others, no matter their age as well as submerge themselves into a hobby. 


## Website 1 : [Goodreads]
<br> (https://www.goodreads.com/)</br> (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodreads-book-reviews/id355833469) 

Goodreads is a social website geared towards enthusiastic readers. Users can write their own reviews, rate, comment and like other reviews, create, create/join groups as well as follow authors for updates. Besides the social aspect, users can also simply keep track of books they’ve interacted with as well as receive recommendations.

<b>Why I chose this website:</b>

Goodreads is not an attractive website/application. For the longest time, it was simply cluttered with simple text and barely any visuals. Now there is a bit more balance but still, it is not an attractive app especially considering its age and backing (est. in 2007 and bought by Amazon 2013). 

<b>Overall evaluation:</b>

In my opinion, the app feels like it’s missing a little bit of something in each area of its IOS mobile application. It’s not a very fun app to be on due to its outdated UI. It also has typical system errors like slow loading pages and it even freezes a lot. 


<h2> Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation guided by class notes + Nielson Norman Group Rates </h2> 

<br> 1 = denotes that it is a small cosmetic/non imperative problem only; can be fixed when time allows it  
</br>
<br> 
2 = this is a Minor usability problem: has some priority but not imperative </br>
<br>
3 = this is a Major usability problem: this denotes an imperative issue that must be fixed </br>



<h2>1. Visibility of System Status</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> The users are well informed/updated about the actions they’ve done while interacting with the system. The feedback they receive may come in visual, audio, and haptic forms. </p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b> When the user is on a book’s profile page, you can rate the book using the 5- star system provided or place the book in the “Read” bookshelf. Once the reader does either action, a little box below the rating system is revealed that says “Write a Review”. However, once the user clicks “Done” to publish the review there is no indication given to show that the review was successfully published. The user has to reload the book’spage or wait some moments to see. (2)
<br> </br>
<b> Issue:</b> Another similar event occurs when one rates the book using the 5-star system. The user simply has to click on the star position in order to give it a rating. For example, if I want to rate a book 2 stars out of 5 then I simply click the second star from the left to do so. For this action, two indications are given: the number of stars one selects turns yellow and big for a moment and the book is categorized into one’s “Read” bookshelf. However, once again, there is no clear indication that the actions were actually saved since multiple times, when I’ve rated a book, my rating does not save. The feedback Goodreads gives users only tells them that they’ve done said action but not actually save/published it. (1)
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendation: </b>First, have there be an option to save the review as a draft. There have been many times when I’ve thought I published my review but when I go back to view the review, it isn’t there. Second, have a pop up box indicating that the review is as published with an accompanying link to view it on the book’s page. This way users can surely know their actions were saved. 
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendation: </b>For the other similar event, have a little visual to show that the star rating function process was completed. It could be the pop up simply saying “You rated this book! Now tell us why!” appear. 


<h2>2. Match between system and the real world
</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> The system speaks the users’ language so that only concepts, words, images, shapes, and other things familiar to them are shared. 
</p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b>For this heuristic, I will be focusing on a missing concept on the Goodreads application (and even website). Again, Goodreads sells itself as a social website for book readers. Yet, it does not allow the simple function of simply sharing an update. Many times, users simply want to write a small update about a new book cover they saw, how they saw an author is releasing a graphic novel and is recommending all to read the book before it releases or even about how good/bad the book is reading (mid reading session). Simply put, this social media website is missing a huge concept of social media which is allowing members of a community to update each other over even the smallest of events. Which in turn can lead to further discussions. As of right now, discussions and interactions are limited towards people in groups and those who share reviews. (3)
<br> </br>
<b>My recommendation:</b> On the home page of the application, where all the social updates are shared, integrate a new box/icon that allows users to share update with others. For the location, Goodreads can even code so that the only locations users can use are book titles as a fun way to signify that updates should be as book related as they can be. Because as of rig by now, Goodreads does not have very many things that promote interactions. 

<h2>3. User control and freedom:</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> System enables users to fix their mistakes and/or change their minds by allowing them to go back to another state, erase/undo actions, or to exit a process/flow. </p>
</details> 

<b>Issue: </b> Goodreads allows readers to post reviews, comment, and like. Another issue with the review process is that since there is no draft option, exiting the review process causes the user to lose the whole action. (3)
<br> </br> 
<b>Issue:</b> In the settings, it allows you to go back to the previous state but not in a seamless process. To go back to the last page that has all possible settings (for the account, profile, privacy, etc.) after choosing a setting, one has to click on the blue-colored text “Setting”. Clicking the more obvious, back function takes the user back to the initial settings page after user clicking on settings in the “More” section. So the back function, does not take users to the direct previous state but the initial one. (1)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue: </b>Another thing I wanted to note, there is not much to say about this heuristic because of the lack of freedom the user has on the application. (2)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue: </b> With what is allowed (reviewing, commenting, liking, rating), Goodreads does allow users to delete all but only edit reviews and star ratings. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113949962-0b5e1a00-97c5-11eb-8fca-2af7682f3d43.png)

<br> </br>
<b>Issue: </b>Once you join a group on the app, there is no option to leave the group. (3)
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendation: </b>Simply have the back function take users black to the direct previous state. This is also an issue concurring with the second heuristic since it does not match with the real word interpretation of the back function. Users are familiar with a back function that goes to the previous state directly. 
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendation: </b>The application is really bare bones. It needs to give users the freedom to customize the application especially for such a text heavy application, there is no power to make it accessible. even just a few toggles to change the text size, picture size, etc. Would be extremely helpful. 

<h2>4. Consistency and standards:</h2> 
<details> 
<summary> definition </summary>
<p>The system should have consistent formats, fonts, actions, etc. as well as follow platform conventions.  All so that the user is never lost or confused. </p> 
</details>

<b>Issue:</b>Again, to revisit a previous state that was mentioned, after the initial settings page and once any of the options (account, privacy, etc) is selected, on those (possible) selected ones, in the upper right is “Settings” underlined and typed in blue. Nowhere else does something similar appear in the system. (1)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113950593-968bdf80-97c6-11eb-88c9-ceed436c5b6b.png)

<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b>in the Goodreads app, book titles are displayed in an inconsistent manner. Some are displayed as if they are in bookshelves, some are displayed as a few stacked together, and some book titles have a blur effect on them. (2)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b>On the “More” options page, instead of the typical system’s design of white backgrounds with colored text (limited to blue, dark brown, and black) or black/colored background with white text, the options on this page have a gray textured background with beige text. (2)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113951111-c2f42b80-97c7-11eb-8965-ac66098c41ea.png)

<br> </br>
<b>Recommendations:</b> For the first issue, simply remove the specified text I mentioned. For the second issue, have a more consistent way of displaying book titles. Since it’s a book-centered website, I think either choosing to display them as if they were on a bookshelf or stacked would make sense. The blur effect seemed completely out of place. For the last issue, simply change the More page to fit the rest of the website’s design. 


<h2>5. Error prevention:</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p>System prevents errors and/or unwanted actions from occurring.</p>
</details>

When editing a review, if the user decides to cancel it, the app prompts the user with a pop up message to make sure that it wasn’t a mistake. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113949898-e8336a80-97c4-11eb-8d61-fdc06f6b55cd.png)

<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b>The prompt does not appear anywhere else. (1)
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendation:</b>Similar to a previous recommendation, the review page should include a pop message asking a user if they are sure of their writing. Because, an user could have made a mistake and accidentally decided to cancel or publish the review.


<h2>6. Recognition rather than recall:</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p>The system should try to minimize the use of the users’ memory.</p>
</details>

<b>Issue:</b>Goodreads has no section where it shows you the books you previously looked at. (1)
<br> </br> 
<b>Issue:</b> When searching for groups, the app does not display a possible list of groups that matches the words the user typed in. (1)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b>When searching for books, typos may affect if a list of possible books displays or not. (2)
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendations:</b>On the discover page, include a short list of the books the users looked at before. Since the only way to “save” books is to add them to a bookshelf, this new section would allow users to review their options a bit more before they clutter their bookshelves. For the last two, make the search more inclusive so that the possible options are always listed below the search bar as the user is typing. 


<h2>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p>Gives user the ability to change their system experience to be flexible towards them. Like allow for customization in displays and allow them to designate keyboard shortcuts.</p>
</details>

<b>Issue:</b> Users have very little control as to what is shared with them on the app. If Goodreads recommends a book to me on my update, there is no option on the notification to give any sort of positive or negative reaction toward the recommendation (this is no way to improve an user’s personal algorithm). (2)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b>Users cannot block or report other users. (2)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b> In order to view a user’s own review one has to search for it on the user’s profile page by scrolling through the updates or to go to the book’s page and scroll through those reviews. (1)
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendations:</b> 1. allow users to react to recommendations so that better recommendations may be given in the future. 2. Allow users to block and report other users this gives them the flexibility to change their environment on the app. 3. On a user’s page, have a section dedicated to just their reviews for easy viewing. 


<h2>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> 
System design is not cluttered and easy on the eyes - no issues arise nor stem from the design. There are no unnecessary objects as well. 
</p> 
</details>

<b>Issue:</b> Goodreads is not a visually appealing app. Shown in each section of the app, the pictures of the book covers are all small. And it seems like text carries the same weight of importance as the covers themselves. With some details like an author’s name, not being displayed well. The book covers, when clicked on, instead of showing a high resolution image, it is blurry.  The good is that when the book covers are the main focus, the resolution looks good. (3)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b>Once again the “More” page is an issue since it doesn’t match the aesthetic of the website and instead of looking “minimalistic” it simply looks very bare-boned. (2)
<br> </br>
<b>Issue:</b> Right now, it is a bit confusing as to why is the priority of the website. (3)
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendations:</b> 1). Make the book cover images bigger and match the text accordingly so that the cover is illuminated and the text provides the explanation. 2). Again, change the “More” page so that covers the entire page and matches the aesthetic of the website. 
3. The website is a social media website for readers. The app itself is very limiting as to what a user can do to interact with others. It seems more like a personal endeavor with the occasional interaction. Goodreads needs to focus on the abilities it can give the community to personalize their experience and match one of  the initial goals of the site: to bring users together. 

<h2>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p>The system should display Error messages with possible instructions/solutions simple enough so that users can understand the errors and follow the necessary steps to correct them.</p>
</details>

When there isn’t an internet connection, Goodreads tells the user clearly of such an occurrence and gives them instructions on what to do next.  No recommendations. 


<h2>10. Help and documentation</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p>The system, when needed, can readily provide information to aid the user.</p>
</details>

<b> Issue: </b> There is a help page for users. It is a list filled with possible questions they may have. It has a search function and an option to contact Goodreads directly as well. The location of it is a bit weird (1)

<b>Recommendations </b> The help page shouldn’t be in the settings page but it’s own section on the “More” page. It would make it easier for users to look for it. 


## Website 2: [Libby]
<br> (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606)</br>

Libby is a digital library that serves over 70 US library branches and well as some outside of the USA. It allows users to check out digital reads such as ebooks, magazines, as well as audio books for 2 / 3 weeks. Since it is partnered through different library systems, a user must have a library account already in order to use Libby. 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113951089-b7086980-97c7-11eb-9310-e45bded9dbd8.png)

<b>Why I chose this website:</b>

I’ve watched Libby grow from a very small, slow, and unattractive application to once that grew into one of my favorite applications. While it is easy to use, there are still instances where I find the app too difficult to use for what it is: a way to read. 

<b>Overall evaluation:</b>

In my opinion, the app does a great job of allowing the user to customize their reading experience. But the overall application experience still needs some work on especially considering accessibility isn’t just needed in one area but the entire application. A fact that Libby overlooked. All in all, it is a suitable app as it is for all users especially the elderly. 

<h2>1.Visibility of System Status</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> The users are well informed/updated about the actions they’ve done while interacting with the system. The feedback they receive may come in visual, audio, and haptic forms. </p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b> As, the user reads a book, the book may suddenly go blank but with no indication as to why. (2)
<br></br>

<b> Recommendation: </b> Simply, including an error message as to what interaction of the user caused for the error to occur would be helpful. Because with a blank page, the user will simply assume they have to wait for it to load or they might assume the page is frozen. 

<h2>2. Match between system and the real world
</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> The system speaks the users’ language so that only concepts, words, images, shapes, and other things familiar to them are shared. 
</p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b> When there is no internet and with internet, and the user tries to read a book sample, the book is automatically tagged in the system with a cake emoticon. Tagged items can be seen on the bookshelf area. (2)

<br> </br>
<b>My recommendation:</b> delete this automatic tagging feature. Once the internet is working again, the book/s tagged with a cake are gone so there is no way of revisiting your books from earlier through the system’s tags. It seems like this feature only works sometimes. The icons are also very very small. They’re difficult to decipher. 

<h2>3. User Control and Freedom
</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary>
<p> System enables users to fix their mistakes and/or change their minds by allowing them to go back to another state, erase/undo actions, or to exit a process/flow 
</p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b> If a user accidentally chose the wrong library they are a member of, there is no way to go back to correct their mistake. User has to delete the app and start all over. (3)
<br> </br> 
<b> Recommendation: </b> Allow users to correct this mistake by simply including an option at below  saying something like “Chose Wrong Library? Correct it Here.” Instead of sending the user back to the home page. 


<h2>Consistency and standards:</h2> 
<details> 
<summary> definition </summary> 
<p>The system should have consistent formats, fonts, actions, etc. as well as follow platform conventions. All so that the user is never lost or confused. </p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b> The application does not follow the general convention in that there are no setting options on the app. The only setting in the app are the ones concerned with the actual reading experience. (3)
<br> </br> 
<b> Recommendation: </b> Include a typical settings feature on the application. Perhaps where the bookshelf is so that readers can customize the app. 

<h2> Error prevention:</h2> 
<details> 
<summary> definition </summary> 
<p>System prevents errors and/or unwanted actions from occurring. </p>
</details> 

When the user inputs the wrong PIN number the application recommends the user want steps to take from retrying to visiting their FAQ/Help page. 
<br> </br>
<b>Recommendation: </b> no recommendation

<h2>7. Recognition rather than recall:</h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary> 
<p>The system should try to minimize the use of the users’ memory. </p>
</details>
<b>Issue: </b>Can only search for book titles and authors. Does not allow one to search for fantasy, character names, nor can there be any miss spellings. (2) 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113949909-eff30f00-97c4-11eb-90c4-43d60829b809.png)

<br> </br> 
<b> Recommendation: </b> Have a more relaxed search function since a lot of readers often only know one thing about a book they’ve read, and limiting what they can search would disable readers from finding the books they want to read. 


<h2> 8. Flexibility and efficiency of use </h2> 
<details> 
<summary> definition </summary> 
<p>Gives users the ability to change their system experience to be flexible towards them. Like allow for customization in displays and allow them to designate keyboard shortcuts. </p>
</details>

<b> Issue: </b> Again, without a settings option for the application itself, the users do not have much flexibility with how they can enjoy the application. (3) It does have good settings for the reading experience. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113950620-a1df0b00-97c6-11eb-8b6b-3d98e90248f3.png)

<br> </br> 
<b> Recommendations: </b> include a settings page for the application that includes the conventional settings, changes to text, be able to change to a night/dark theme, change language of application, etc. 


<h2> Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
<details> 
<summary> definition <summary>
<p> System design is not cluttered and easy on the eyes - no issues arise nor stem from the design. 
</p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b> Interface is simple and clean. 
The only confusing aspect is that the library icon directs the user to the homepage (which surprisingly isn’t one’s bookshelf). The big circle icon on the bottom of the app simply leads users to a new page to manage notifications and to look for answers (the help page). (1)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82078120/113949904-ecf81e80-97c4-11eb-8be7-91cd967d5f64.png)

<br> </br> 
<b>Recommendation: </b> Not sure the best way to combat the interface issue. Right now, the most important change I can think of is concerning The icons at the bottom of the app since that’s what’s creating the (very little) clutter the app has. My thought is that everything can probably be condensed into 3 icons. 


<h2> 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2> 
<details>
<summary> definition </summary> 
<p>The system should display error messages with possible instructions/solutions simple enough so that users can understand the errors and follow the necessary steps to correct them. </p>
</details>

<b> Issue: </b> When reading a story, the goes can suddenly go blank with no indication from Libby as to why it does that. First time and regular users will be greatly confused. (3)

<br> </br> 
<b>Recommendation: </b> Include an error message as to why instances such as this occur. My assumption is due to the internet connection but that is my guess only having experienced this multiple times. 

<h2> 10. Help and documentation </h2>
<details>
<summary> definition </summary> 
<p>The system, when needed, can readily provide information to aid the user. </p>
</details>

<b>Issue: </b>There is a help page for users. It is a list filled with possible questions they may have. It has a search function. Only thing missing is a way to contact Libby directly for a question. One can only contact Libby concerning an app crash(1)


<br></br> 
<b> Recommendations: </b> include a way to contact for questions/comments on the help page within the app to on the website (the user is directed to the website from a link in the app if the app’s guide can’t help them).
